<p> It's really too hard to say what is the best about a rabbit. Besides the hind legs. They are the best.  Also, though the body, body pieces are quite delicious. They are the best. Upon reflection though, the stomach flap pieces, wow. Like some kind of alien amazing bacon. They are the best.  The font legs, well, they're a little gamey. They are not the best.  SO. They are so cute.
